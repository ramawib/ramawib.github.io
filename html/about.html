                <h1>Hello There!</h1>
                <p>Hi! It is a very good honor to have you here on my website. While it may not be the best looking website (and there might still be some
                    flaws here and there), but I do hope that you enjoy the experience here. My name is Dimas Rama Satrio Wibowo, but people usually calls me
                    Dimas. I am currently a student at the University of Indonesia, majoring in Library and Information Science. Let me tell you something about myself
                    a little bit.

            <h2>When were you born?</h2>
            <img class="image" src="../assets/monas.jpg">
            <p>I was born on December 11th, 2001 in the Capital City Jakarta, Indonesia. I am 18 years old right now by the time I made this website. 
                Ever since I was born, I grow up and stayed in Jakarta.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="container about">
                <h2>What school did you go to?</h2>
                <img class="image" src="../assets/sman65.jpg">
                <p>I went to SMAN 65 Jakarta High School in Kebon Jeruk, West Jakarta. I took the social science program for three years.
                    I am mostly active in the school choir activity. I also joined the Japanese Club of SMAN 65 Jakarta.

            <div class="container about">
                <h2>What are your interests?</h2>
                <img class="image" src="../assets/music.jpg">
                <p>Music and imaginations.</br> I actually have a lot of interests, but my main interests are music and imaginations.
                    I adore musical stuffs and I love to daydream. With music, I can express myself and let
                    my imaginations to flow out from the music that I hear and played. Sometimes I like to tap my finger to a rhythm which
                    is pretty weird. <strike>Oh, and I also like social and political stuffs.</strike>
                </p>

            <div class="container about">
                <h2>What is your hobby?</h2>
                <img class="image" src="../assets/guitar.jpg">
                <p>In relation to my interests, I also have a hobby in musical stuffs. I play musical instruments and I play the guitar as my main instrument, 
                    but I also played other instruments such as keyboard and violin. I also joined a community choir that usually rehearse every week on Sunday.
                </p>

            <div class="container about">
                <h2>Who's your role model?</h2>
                <img class="image" src="../assets/gerald.jpg">
                <p>Honestly, this is hard to pick since I have a lot of role models in my life. But if I have to choose one, I'll go with Gerald Situmorang.
                    It's kind of ironic since I adore him, yet I made this website about ONE OK ROCK information.
                    Gerald Situmorang or better known as GeSit is a guitarist from Indonesia. He mainly  plays jazz and progressive songs. The reason why
                    I adore him is because of his virtuosity in music, not only as a guitarist but also as a bassist, producer, and even sound engineer.
                    The songs that he wrote are pleasant to the ears and rich of flavors. That's why, I aim forward to be like him and soothe others with
                    the music that I play, just like what GeSit does.

            <div class="container about">
                <h2>Lastly, why library and information science?</h2>
                <img class="image" src="../assets/library.jpg">
                <p>Why not? I mean, library and information science (LIS) is not about being a librarian sitting behind the librarian's desk and asking
                    people to be quiet. LIS talks way more beyond that. Also, LIS has a lot of work potential in the future since it focus on information management.
                    Who doesn't need information these days? Information is a valuable resource for everyone and it needs to be managed so that people can find
                    the information with ease based on their need. That's why, I think LIS is a potential major and therefore I picked it for that reason.
